// this is essentially a total rewrite of https://github.com/eggborne/pazaak (mikedonovan.dev/pazaak)
// but with no class components and full use of Hooks
// and also no PHP (except for getting Name Generator ruleset)
// and better integration of the Name Generator (https://github.com/eggborne/customizable-name-generator)

5/8 ----------------------------------------

Production build needs line in package.json:
"homepage": "/spacecards",
(may be fixed by prepending image reference with %PUBLIC_URL% as in public/index.html ???) --> NO

NameGenerator let a triple 'S' through despite using the current 'Star Wars 3' ruleset (should not!)

> FooterGameButtons should be passed as props to Footer? 
> Game class imported from its own file?

--------------------------------------------

1. Make a single GUEST match against 'Opponent' work

    components needed:

    // GameScreen
      // > PlayerArea x 2 (50% of board)
        // > CardArea (~65% of PlayerArea)
          // > Card x 9 (90% of CardArea)
          > ScoreDisplay (10% of CardArea)
            > score
            > SetWinIndicator (3 knobs)
        // > HandArea (~35% of PlayerArea)
          // > PlayerPortrait
          // > Card x 4
          > TurnIndicator

    // Card (CSS for shapes usable from old project?)

    // Footer (when phase is 'game-board-showing')
      > GameControlArea
        > buttons for Stand, Draw, hamburger menu with 'quit game'

// 2. Set up login system so as to enable App state 'userLoggedIn' to be set within handleClickLogin

3. for render, check 'userLoggedIn' to use sequence:

  userLoggedIn ?
  2. GameModeSelectScreen
    Quick Match ? 
    3. GameScreen 
    Campaign ? 
    3. DeckSelectScreen
    4. OpponentSelectScreen
    5. GameScreen

  !userLoggedIn ?
  1. AvatarChoiceModal
  2. GameModeSelectScreen
    Quick Match ? 
    3. GameScreen 
    Campaign ? 
    3. OpponentSelectScreen
    4. GameScreen
