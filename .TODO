    components needed:

    GameScreen
      > PlayerArea
        > CardArea
        > HandArea

    Card (CSS for shapes usable from old project?)

    Footer (when phase is 'game-board-showing')
      > GameControlArea
        > buttons for Stand, Draw, hamburger menu with 'quit game'

2. Set up login system so as to enable App state 'userLoggedIn' to be set within handleClickLogin

  1. DeckSelectScreen (not shown to GUEST)
  2. OpponentSelectScreen (not shown to GUEST)
  3. GameScreen
